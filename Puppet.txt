Puppet :
Introduction:
			Puppet is a configuration and management tool used to configure the servers in  the cloud or on prem. Puppet
			manages configuration data , including users , packages and services. 
			Puppet uses declarative language. No need to study extra language for this. This is more readable language. 
			Puppet automate the task of configuration and management on thousands of nodes.
			Puppet DSL example:
				
				user { 'Joe':
					ensure     => present,
					id		   => '1001',
					gid        => '1000',
					comment    => 'Joe User',
					managehome => true,
				}
				
			This was the resource declaration. User is the resource which is declared. Such more resources will be combined
			and enlisted in a single entity which is called as Class. Now Class is the configuration script for the puppet.
			Everything that we need to perform on node or servers can be mentioned in the Class. 
			
			Example of Class
			
				Class Class_name {
					Resource { 
						configuration..
					}
					Resource {
						confiration 
					}
				    ..
					..
					..
					..
				} 
				
Node Classification : 
	It is the process of assigning a class to the node for processing.
	
Puppet is a master-agent type of environment. 
Puppet Enterprise Stack and Core concepts:
	Puppet Master:
		Puppet master is the tool installed on the system when puppet is installed. Puppet master is responsible for 
		creating catalogues , configuration files for agent nodes. More over this is the workstation where we writes 
		configuration and configure servers.
	
	Catalogue:
		Catalogue is the document downloaded from the master to the agent node. This catalogue contains all the information
		about the desired state of the nodes.
	
	Puppet Agent:
		Puppet agent is the tool or pragram install on all nodes and servers that we want to manage and configure. puppet
		agent will do the convergence after every 30 min by default and pull the catalogue and implements the changes 
		on the servers.
		
Puppet Process:
	Install puppet master and puppet agents
	Create configurations files (modules/classes) which includes resources which tell the desired state of the node
	Assign these configuration files to the nodes or servers.
		configuration can be assigned or declared in the console.
		configuration can be assigned or declared in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp
		
		
Puppet master Installation:

	1. choose server puppet enterprise will be installed.
	2. Download the puppet enterprise tarball
	3. Extract the tarball
	4. make sure these ports are open : 3000 8140 61613 443 5432 
	5. cd /etc/ssh/
	6. vim sshd_config
	7. Uncommented Permit Root Login and make sure yes is there
	8. restart ssh configuration --> service sshd restart
	9. check hostname of the server
	10.vim /etc/hosts  --> add hostname here in correct location after 127.0.0.1 and before localhost.localdomain 
	11. cd puppet-enterprise dir
	12. ./puppet-enterprise-installer  
	13. take the URL and hit that in browser
	14. select monolothic or split according to the requirement. 
	15. for practice use Monolithic.
	16. put hostname in puppet master FQDN
	17. Put SSH username and password
	18. create console username and addess 
	19. continue the process
	This process will take significantly long time
	20. click start using puppet enterprise 
	21. Enter credentials
	22. you can see the dashboard
	
	Here PE is officially installed.
When PE is installed some other services will also be installed. So these services are:
	pe-console-auth
	pe-httpd
	pe-installer
	pe-mcollective
	pe-postgresql
	pe-puppet
	pe-puppet-dashboard
	pe-puppet-db
	hiera
	facter

All log folders will be created for all these services in /var/log directory. For troubleshooting any service, these log 
files will be helpfull.

In /etc/puppetlabs dir all required configuration files are placed. All configuration we do in this directory. core puppet
policy lives in puppet dir. 
puppet.conf is the configuration files which is very important

Installing Puppet Agent from Puppet Master.
	1. fire up fresh machine and connect to it using root user and consider that as a server
	2. saveral ports need to be open 443 8140(to communicate to puppet master) should be open.
	3. curl -k https://hostname.com:8140/packages/current/install.bash | bash 
    4. This will download puppet agent 
	5. look for ensure => running then agent is installed successfully and running
	6. type --> puppet agent -t (test flag)
	7. on puppet master check certs --> puppet cert list 
	8. puppet cert sign hostname_of_node or certificate name listed in puppet master
	9. puppet cert sign -a --> sign all certificates 
	10. run again puppet agent -t
